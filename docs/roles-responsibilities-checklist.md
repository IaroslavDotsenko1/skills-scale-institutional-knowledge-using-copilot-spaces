## RACI Quick Reference

Use this RACI model to clarify accountability:
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (owns the outcome, final decision-maker)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated)

### Guidelines
- Each task should have exactly **one** person Accountable
- Multiple people can be Responsible or Consulted
- Avoid having too many people in Consulted status (creates bottlenecks)
- Review and update RACI assignments as the project evolves
